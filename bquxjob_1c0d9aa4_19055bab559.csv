While looking at your account I noticed nothing was charged to your account while you were gone, the only charge is for this month which gives you the next 30days to workout.  Based on your notes it seems like you were looking to come back so I think this is a win win- Let me know when I can book you for your next burn.  Definitely miss having you in the studio and am looking forward to visiting your spa as well.

Review: It truly pains me to leave a bad review, but after my experience trying to cancel this membership, I have no choice. I have been trying to cancel this membership since may, and we are now in august. I loved orange theory's classes and coaches, they will give you great service until you try to cancel. They make the process almost impossible and good luck getting a refund for the months they will charge you after you decide to cancel. There is always some issue with ""corporate"".
I went at the end of April, filled out a cancellation form which they claim not to have on file. I sent out a change of address form because since I moved I could not reasonably commute to forest hills. They said they were going to cancel the membership in June and could not refund may. They charged june, and charged july again.
I had to call back they said I was going to get a refund for both months. I got receipt for a refund for July, nothing for June. I am calling these people every week all I got was a receipt, no actual refund. I called my bank, they have nothing from OTF, yet they said everything was done on their end. So all I have is a fake return receipt for one month.
I call again and again trying to speak to the owner, Vanessa, but apparently she is never available.  When it comes to bringing new business (members) or getting a more expensive membership, I can assure you they will call you back and chase you around. However, when you try to leave they make it almost impossible and will keep on charging you for as long as they can.

Upon review of the account it seems the protocols of a 30 day notice to cancel were followed. There was a 13 month freeze on the account which lifted when the gyms restrictions lifted across NYC.

The front desk is always helpful. My qualm with OT is their cancellation policy which is rapacious.  Here's how it works.  Assume you join and pay on 8/1/22 and that covers you until 8/31/22. You're then charged on 9/1/22 and you then decide to cancel on 9/5/22.  OT will then charge you AGAIN on 10/1/22 and your cancellation goes into effect on 10/31/22.  So effectively, as soon as you pay for a month, you're guaranteed to pay for at least one more month, no matter when you cancel.  There's no reason why OT can't just prorate your bill and only charge you for a full month from the date you cancel.  In my opinion, this is due to pure greed on the part of the owners.

The front desk is always helpful. My qualm with OT is their cancellation policy which is rapacious.  Here's how it works.  Assume you join and pay on 8/1/22 and that covers you until 8/31/22. You're then charged on 9/1/22 and you then decide to cancel on 9/5/22.  OT will then charge you AGAIN on 10/1/22 and your cancellation goes into effect on 10/31/22.  So effectively, as soon as you pay for a month, you're guaranteed to pay for at least one more month, no matter when you cancel.  There's no reason why OT can't just prorate your bill and only charge you for a full month from the date you cancel.  In my opinion, this is due to pure greed on the part of the owners.  Last but not least, I called the studio and brought this to the attention of the front desk over one week ago and I asked to have a manager call me to discuss.

Review: booked my second class since COVID started and I was super pumped to get back into OTF since I was a pretty die hard fan pre-pandemic.

Seems I missed the cutoff by 2 minutes!
I explained to Vanessa that parking is impossible by the store and even asked if she can make a one time exception and allow me to rebook for a later class seeing as I missed the deadline by 2 minutes. Vanessa flat out refused to allow it and even chimed in that this would be considered a ‚Äúlate cancellation penalty‚Äù

Review: It pains me to leave a negative review as I have been an Orange Theory member for the past two years. While most OTF locations are great, the customer service at the Forest Hills location is extremely poor. I've only been late twice, both times due to severe train delays, and showed up for class as soon as I could. Despite this, the representative informed me that I couldn't enter the class, which I understand as per policy. However, what is disappointing is that despite my effort to arrive and explain the situation, they still insisted on charging me for being late.

I‚Äôve been doing it for a year now and this is the longest I‚Äôve stuck with a gym. The coaches are really good at what they do and the workouts are always so different and challenging. I‚Äôm never bored! I do wish it was easier to book classes on weekends, the times I want to go to are always full. I also wish the app told you when you accidentally book an extra class, there‚Äôs no warning when you book that you will be charged.","[customer service, billing practices, variety]",customer service, billing practices, variety,,,,,,,

This was my second attempt to go. After my experience, I just joined another gym around the corner.
The first time was for a 5:30am class. I arrived at 5:15 since it was so early. The person who oriented wouldn't let me take the class since she said that there wasn't enough time to orient. Yet we spent the first 15 minutes going over merchandise, bathrooms. I am an athlete and familiar with HR zones. Instead I wish she was flexible and could orient me to the equipment and coach. She already knew I had a concept2 rower in my basement. Then I could start a few minutes late while she oriented me to the brand. Anyway she finished her orientation just before 5:30 and still wouldn't consider letting me try the class.  I was excited to be part of OTF since I‚Äôve heard good things. But I was so turned off. It was an early morning to wake up for nothing.
I waited 6 months before attempting to go again. This time I was THREE minutes late. I explained that I already went through the first half of the orientation, but the front staff was still not willing to make any adjustments.

This place definitely has a better vibe! The facility, including the bathrooms and lockers are spotless. If you are searching for kick-a** workouts that you‚Äôll never get bored of, then give this studio a try!","[overall experience, coaches, cleanliness, variety]",overall experience, coaches, cleanliness, variety,,,,,,

The whole crew is the entire package, from the front, manager, and coach (Al, Alex, Kyle, Jacqueline) are marvelous!!!! Including a super cute greeter, Lola the Boston Terrier! Lola could be an emotional support dog!*
I appreciate all coaches correcting my form! My personal experience is I never be someone who is considered sporty. I lacked self-esteem for a boutique gym like this since I thought everyone in the boutique gym was viewed as a gym nut or a celebgram, but I was wrong. When I walked in for the first time nine months ago, Vanessa asked me what my fitness goal was; I didn't even know my fitness goal; I just simply said, ""losing all fat I got from quarantine 2020"". In the beginning, I focused on the form and the effectiveness more the weight of my neighbor to prevent the injury and get a better outcome! In my first week, it was a challenge to run one mile. TRUST me, and the first mile is the hardest! Kyle was pushing me to complete the challenge; I was the last person to finish on that day! Al always puts a lot of effort to work on my upper body (my weakness), and Alex constantly challenges me by placing a cone for a core workout (my favorite part)!! Now I'm a completely different person and call myself an athlete, running in my blood now! I am a better runner and able to run with confidence! Finish my last 5k with 21 minutes! I beat myself nine months ago and continue my journey with OTF FOREST HILL!!

Review: Update: I first wrote this review several years ago but felt the need to update because of one instructor in particular.
Alex is, hands down, the best coach I‚Äôve ever seen at an Orangetheory - across the 10+ studios I‚Äôve been to in 5 states. Being in a class with him is like having a personal trainer, given his attention to detail and hands-on approach whether it is giving tips, fixing form, or even just dropping by to say you‚Äôre doing great. This dude can multitask like crazy, and even in a full class he somehow makes time to check up on everyone. You can tell he genuinely enjoys helping people, even staying after class to explain the correct forms in more detail. Sometimes his classes run over but it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs being too helpful (lol). After having been in a few of his classes now, I felt compelled to come here to commend him - I hope OTF Forest Hills keeps him for a long time because his presence alone elevates this studio.
My original review:
I travel a lot so I‚Äôve been to 4 Orangetheory studios across 3 different states, here is what is provided (and not provided) at this specific gym:
- No free borrowing of heart rate monitors (studios in small cities will lend them to you for free, not the case in NY)
- No towels (the only studio I‚Äôve ever been to that does not provide towels)
- No surcharge fee (most NYC studios have a special, additional fee for booking if it‚Äôs not your home studio; in Manhattan it‚Äôs $20 and in Brooklyn it‚Äôs $10)
- Filtered water (from tap, but has a filter so it‚Äôs not just a drinking fountain)
- Free lockers with built-in locks
- Showers
- Coat rack
- No pressure to sign up for a membership if you‚Äôre only on a class package (some studios can be very pushy)
The staff and trainers are friendly, they make a genuine effort to learn names and remember faces. Really the only thing they can improve upon is providing small towels. I don‚Äôt have a monthly membership so I can‚Äôt speak to any billing experiences but the lack of studio surcharge at this location is a big win for traveling package holders like me.",ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURNNEpqVG9nRRAB,2840,en,,Orangetheory Fitness,"107-14 70th Rd, Queens, NY",https://www.google.com/search?q=Orangetheory+Fitness+107-14+70th+Rd%2C+Queens%2C+NY&sort=newestFirst&hl=en&gl=US&gws_rd=cr&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&uule=w+CAIQIFISCQs2MuSEtepUEUK33kOSuTsc,2024-06-26 16:50:32 +00:00,5,5,2022-06-26 16:50:06 +00:00,"Update: I first wrote this review several years ago but felt the need to update because of one instructor in particular.
